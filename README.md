# ransompy

The idea of this simple project is to replicate a ransomware behavior and learn some Python along the way.

I have chosen the simplest cryptography algorithm, the Caesar's Cipher (read more [here:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher])

The steps are something along the following lines, not in order:

- Manually create the Cipher script
- Encrypt a text file
- Encrypt the same text file without passing its location
- Decrypt the Cipher
